    Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It defines the content and structure of web content. It is often assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript, a programming language.
        Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for its appearance.</p>

            Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for specifying the presentation
             and styling of a document written in a markup language such as HTML or XML (including XML
              dialects such as SVG, MathML or XHTML). CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World
               Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.

            CSS is designed to enable the separation of content and presentation, including layout, colors, and fonts.[4] This separation can improve content accessibility, since the content can be written without concern for its presentation; provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics; enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file, which reduces complexity and repetition in the structural content; and enable the .css file to be cached to improve the page load speed between the pages that share the file and its formatting.</p>

            JavaScript, often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language and core technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS. Ninety-nine percent of websites use JavaScript on the client side for webpage behavior.[10]

            Web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine that executes the client code. These engines are also utilized in some servers and a variety of apps. The most popular runtime system for non-browser usage is Node.js.</p>

            <p><img src="./react-img.jpg" title="React logo" alt="React logo image" align="right">
                React (also known as React.js or ReactJS) is a free and open-source front-end JavaScript library that 
                aims to make building user interfaces based on components more "seamless".[5] It is maintained by Meta (formerly Facebook)
                 and a community of individual developers and companies

                React can be used to develop single-page, mobile, or server-rendered applications with frameworks 
                like Next.js and Remix[a]. Because React is only concerned with the user interface and rendering components to
                 the DOM, React applications often rely on libraries for routing and other client-side functionality. A key advantage of React is that it only
                  re-renders those parts of the page that have changed, avoiding unnecessary re-rendering of unchanged DOM elements.
